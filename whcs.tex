\begin{abstract}
The presence of wireless technologies and proliferation of mobile controlled devices have inspired a push toward consumer based home automation systems. Wireless Home Control System is a home automation framework designed to compete with popular solutions in the domain. The system features peripheral control modules capable of interacting with lights, outlets, doors, and sensors. All control modules communicate with a central hub that is paired with a mobile device to provide total control to the user. We describe the hardware and software necessary to conceive this system.

\section{Introduction}
The Wireless Home Control System is meant to be a solution for any homeowner to
be able to remotely control core appliances of their home. The WHCS vision is
to allow the user to control lights, outlets, doors, and sensors around their
home. The system{}'s design philosophy emphasizes ease of use, affordability,
and effectiveness. An Android phone application developed for WHCS will allow
users to monitor the state of the installed components and activate them
remotely. A central base station equipped with a touch{}-enabled LCD will be
present to allow the users to interact with the system without the need of a
phone. Peripheral control modules will be installed into the targeted
appliances such as lights, outlets, and doors for WHCS to control. Together the
phone, base station, and peripheral control modules will constitute WHCS.

The implementation of such a system requires research in a myriad of fields to
produce a full{}-fledged product. Android software development is the core for
creating the users first impression with WHCS. Research must be conducted to
conform to the design philosophies of the Android ecosystem. The alternative
interface offered for WHCS will be the base station{}'s display, as a result
the best solution for a touch capable LCD will be examined. Communication
devices will form the foundation for the wireless aspect of WHCS, thus an
investigation into the advantages of different communication modules is
required to realize the system. A network protocol will need to be planned out
and implemented in order to form a unified system from the independent modules.
The activation of appliances around the home requires high voltage control, so
methodologies for properly harnessing the power provided by homes are a
requirement. To extend upon harnessing the home{}'s power, our individual
control modules and base station{}'s logic level voltage depend upon the
creation of an efficient way to step down the high voltage supplied to the
home. Efficient forms of rectification and power provision will need to be
researched for WHCS to be self{}-sufficient. Important research and critical
design decisions will go into the development of the printed circuit boards
that will provide the foundation for all the hardware of WHCS.

% Base Station
\section{Base Station}
The heart of WHCS resides with the base station (BS). When users think of WHCS, they
will think of the base station as it is the most visible part of the system.
The base station is responsible for managing, collecting, and displaying
information from all of the control modules. If the BS were to fail, WHCS
would cease to function.

When a new control module is introduced in to the system, it must first pair
with the BS, which will authenticate it on to the network. Once it joins, the
control module can be abstracted as an ``API'' meaning, the specific hardware
details do not have to be considered. This abstraction will be excellent in
keeping the system clean from one-off cases and allow for a Domain Specific API
to be formed.

\subsection{Software Flow}
The main software flow for the base station is the most complicated in WHCS. It
has to manage three separate devices simulatenously and be able to service each
one in a timely manner. The LCD, NRF radio, and Bluetooth module are all being
controlled and commanded by one ATMega32-A chip. There isn't much room for busy
waiting or any expensive operations as everything has to be running as fast as
possible. Given this, the BS is the least point of failure for the WHCS.

In \autoref{fig:base-station-flow}, we have constructed the general architecure
of the main loop for the BS, including some early initialization. Most of the
implementation details are left out as they are very specific to the final
drivers.

\ucfgfx[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig:base-station-flow}{base-station-flow}{the high level software flow for the base station}

The large amount of tasks that are required of the BS become clear when viewing
\autoref{fig:base-station-flow}.

The base station from reset would first load any saved settings from the
EEPROM (saved control modules, behavior settings, LCD settings, etc.), then it
would bring up all of the main modules (radio, LCD, BlueTooth, and UART). If
any of these initialization steps were to fail, the BS would indicate through
an LED or from a UART debug message. An initialization failure shouldn't be
handled as it's a critical failure of the system along with its assumptions. We
believe that by assuring that the initialization sequences for all modules is
well defined, we will be able to diagnose hardware issues quickly and without
strenuous debugging. One of the issues we found while prototyping is that it's
difficult to determine if the issue with module initialization is with the
wiring or code. Having a golden model for code that is know to work on our
target setup would allow us to have a good working state.

Each module has a unique sequence of ``commands'' with parameters that are
required to configure the device. The NRF radio has to have its power, channel,
payload length, and other parameters set before usage. Once these basic
options, any further configuration is done at run time. This would include
switching from listening to transmitting mode and enabling or disabling the
automatic acknowledgement feature. The built-in Atmel UART only needs to know
the baud rate at which data will be sent and received. There are also other
options relating to other bits used (parody, stop, etc.). In our case, we are
using the default 8 bit data, 1 stop bit, which is simple enough for our needs.
The LCD happens to have the most extensive initialization sequence due to
required screen configuration, gamma settings, pixel order and other more
archaic options.

Once all of the modules are brought up correctly, the BS would begin the main loop.
Radio events, BlueTooth events, and LCD state would all be processed as
required. For both the BlueTooth and radio, new packets would be checked for
and serviced as needed. From these packets, internal state would updated and any
response packets would be generated and sent. Internally, WHCS will have an
internal event queue with different event types. These events will be processed
and any responses will be generated, if any. These responses could include a
confirmation packet over the NRF radio, or a status update through BlueTooth.
The base station may also initialize actions despite not receiving events.
These could be triggered from timers firing.

In terms of the NRF radio, the module we have chosen exports an interrupt pin
which will fire on the reception of a new packet. This feature is great for the
WHCS architecture as the radio requires a significant amount of power
while actively receiving SPI commands and transmitting. By avoiding the polling
of the NRF, the main loops for both the control module and base station will
have more cycles to process more important and intensive tasks. Essentially,
the NRF will be kept in the listening mode at all times, waiting for a packet
from a control module to be received. This is in contrast to the control
modules which will try to avoid the transmitting and listening states to save
power. The power down mode is great for saving watts, but has very poor
performance for quickly responding to new packets.

The BlueTooth module won't require as much time to service as the other modules
due to the low data rate. It will be connected directly to the hardware UART of
the base station, instead of the normal serial debugger. This will have to be
connected to some free GPIO ports and software serial will be used. This is
unfortunate as ``bit banging'' serial isn't efficient and will take up many
more cycles than just using the hardware UART. If needed, a packet over
BlueTooth could be sent asynchronously from the main loop due to the hardware
UART. If the micro loops fast enough, then it would be as if there was no delay
in transmission. Due to the real time nature of the NRF radio and LCD, WHCS
will take steps to avoid blocking too long on a single activity. Blocking too
much will lower the overall performance and responsiveness of the system. At
worst, touch events could be lost and packet buffers could overflow. Until the
system's code is ready, this worry cannot be confirmed, but an effort will be
made to profile the main loop's average time using hardware timers.

One of the most important parts of WHCS is its usage of timers. A global list
of timers will be constantly maintained and updated to schedule events
in the future, instead of having to handle them immediately. The granularity of
the timers will depend on the average execution time of the main loop along
with how many timers are processed at once. If the main loop is slow on
average, then timers will have to wait for extended periods to be serviced
(starvation). Depending on the criticality of the timer and the event
associated with it, there may need to be a mechanism for assigning a priority
for a timer. This will have to be determined during actual system programming
as it is heavily dependent on the task required.

All of the above tasks will be executing in the same way as single core CPU
would: in pseudo-parallel. The faster the whole system runs, the better the
appearance of everything executing at once.

\subsection{Control Module Abstraction}
For WHCS to function smoothly and scale well, a neat and abstracted interface
must be defined to accept \emph{any} type of control module. New control module
types should be easily added to the system without affecting older types and
there should be a set of generic data structures for managing and storing
information on modules. These structures must be carefully defined to wrap more
specific control module packets in all of the shared metadata. Think of it like
a hierarchy where all of the common attributes and actions shared by control
modules have packets that can be sent to any module. Whereas the more specific
packets (get temperature, engage door, etc.) would be wrapped up in the generic
ones (essentially a derived object from the generic control module.) This can
be visualized in \autoref{fig:ctrl-mod-hierarchy}. The
details of a network structure that would enable this clean interface is
further described in \autoref{sec:network-library}.

\ucfgfx[width=\linewidth]{fig:ctrl-mod-hierarchy}{control-module-hierarchy}{showing the control
module hierarchy for WHCS}

Beyond sending packets, the base station must accurately record and update
state for all of the control modules. Depending on the control module,
additional state will need to be stored and functions will need to be written
to query that state. Each control module would have its own state machine that
would control its function in relation to the base station.

%\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
%struct control_module {
%  enum control_state state; // 1 byte of state
%  uint8_t type; // type of control module - used to delayer *data
%  void * data;  // the specific data for a control module
%};
%
%\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Subsystems}
The base station has the hardest job in the entire WHCS architecture. It has to
juggle a lot of data with limited memory and processing speed. Packets need to be
processed and queued to keep the pipeline flowing smoothly. The following
sections will break down the individual subsystems and how they work in concert
to make the base station a well oiled microcontroller.

\subsubsection{NRF24L01+}
The NRF radio will be directly connected to the Atmega32-A microcontroller
which will control its state. This module will be constantly listening for new
packets from the control modules and sending responses in turn. Due to this
link being the most critical for WHCS, it needs to have the most attention to
detail when constructing the layout and software design. Also, besides the
expensive drawing operations for the LCD, this may take up the most CPU time to
process packets and perform data transfers. This is partly due to the slow SPI
interface that will be used to transfer the data. the NRF24LO1+ breakout board
does not offer any other options for transferring data to and from a
microcontroller. The overall system speed will be limited by the maximum
transfer speed of this radio. When the considerations for thw WHCS topology are
brought forward, its is obvious that the organization relies solely on the
speed of the base station. We have considered this fact throughout the system
design - for example, the LCD could have \emph{also} been controlled over SPI,
but we made a trade off for pin count in order to use the parallel interface.
This frees up the SPI bus for programming (infrequent) and the NRF.
Essentially, the NRF has full control over the SPI bus and will receive the
full attention of the microcontroller. 

Assuming the NRF is not limited by the transfer rate of the SPI bus, the
additional considerations can now be focused on. The microcontroller needs a
way to quickly assess the state of the NRF chip. This state query could include
the status of the radio's transfer queues - meaning if there is a packet to be
received or if a packet has been successfully sent. This is something that will
need to be checked very frequently as the radio usage will increase linearlly
with the amount of control modules that are apart of WHCS. If any algorithms or
tight loops in the microcontroller were to \textbf{not} have linear
performance, then the system speed would suffer as more control modules were
brought in to the network. We are focusing on WHCS' scalability for more
complex households that a small demo setup. Of course, once the network becomes
too crowded, the somewhat weak Atmega32-A will no longer be able to sustain the
flood of packets that are required to maintain WHCS. At this point, more base
stations will need to be operating simultaneously in order to handle the load.
Our implementation of WHCS briefly considers this fact, but due to the
prototype nature of this endeavour, we have left these more complicated details
to another, more scalable revision of WHCS.

In WHCS' architecture, the main loop of the base station will not be
interacting directly with the radio. This is due to the abstraction we plan on
building around the low-level radio driver. All driver specific functions will
be wrapped in to a fa\c{c}ade pattern, network library. This would allow WHCS
to swap out the underlying network hardware for another, similar radio. This
would encourage code reuse and prevent massive, expensive rewrites of the
net code. The high-level interface that the BS will know about will be
sufficient and feature rich enough to carry out all of the actions required for
WHCS to come to fruition.

\subsubsection{HC-05}
The HC-05 BlueTooth module is quite simple in its operations. Data is sent over
a two line serial bus and if there is an active connection to a bluetooth
enabled device, it will be able to easily receive the data and handle it. In
this case the device on the other end is expected to be a phone, but not
limited to one. As long as the device on the other end of the BlueTooth link
follows the WHCS BlueTooth application protocol, then WHCS will be able to
receive commands from arbitrary devices. Assuming that the only thing that will
connected to WHCS is a phone, then a suitable protocol for querying and
changing WHCS' state will need to be derived. This set of functions is
important for more than just the BlueTooth link - if written correctly, it
could scale to many different consumers and producers of commands. A simple
diagram showing a very high level interaction of a BT device with the base
station is for reference in \autoref{fig:android-comm}. Once again
this underlying protocol will be made to be abstracted away from the underlying
hardware. For example, if the HC-05 were to fail to meet WHCS' strict
requirements, then we would have to switch it for the next best unit - the
RN-41. If we write the underlying driver to be ``top level'' layer that the
base station will interact with, then large amount of code and possibly
architecture will have to be swapped out to meet the needs of another hardware
device.

In regards to the application level protocol for WHCS, there will need to be a
well defined, easy way, for the BlueTooth library to gather information from
WHCS' state. This can be handled on the top-level flow of the base station by
gluing together two different libraries without them knowing about each other.
This is a good approach because it will decouple the two modules from each
other, making their individual implementations separate. Two tightly coupled
modules may start to take on the appearance of a ``ball of mud.'' A connected
phone will be able to accomplish any task that manually interacting with the
LCD could handle. This would include controlling the function of individual
modules and querying their current state. The BT connection would try to avoid
generating too many packets over the NRF radio in response to user events.
Instead it would merely lookup the cached state from the base station's memory.
This would be faster and the round trip time would be quick. Also, if a
bluetooth packet did require a packet to be generated over the NRF radio, this
interaction would have to asynchronously tracked until the request was
fulfilled. This would complicate the system, but would allow for more advanced
queries and commands.

\subsubsection{LCD}
In what could be considered the ``face of WHCS'', the LCD module, which will be
situated directly over the Atmega32-A, will have the tough job of accurately
and quickly conveying any desired information about the state of WHCS' control
modules. This is no simple task as not only does it have to display, but with
an attached touchpanel, it has to react to user touches. What functionality is
exported to the LCD is only limited by the underlying processor speed and the
UI library. The high level design of the WHCS LCD will only have to worry about
what the end goals are for its usage. An example of this abstraction may be
viewed in \autoref{fig:lcd-soft-hier}.

\ucfgfx[width=\linewidth]{fig:lcd-soft-hier}{lcd-soft-hier}{the level of abstractions for the LCD
subsystem}

As the state of the WHCS network changes, the base station will have to fire
off redraw events in order to keep the LCD up-to-date. These redraws will sync
the internal state of WHCS with the user viewable interface. The physical
connections to the LCD will consist of data signaling and an 8-bit wide
parallel data bus. There is an optional reset pin that WHCS will opt to use for
emergency resets and debugging. The high level interface with the LCD will
occur directly with the high-level UI library and if necessary the underlying
graphics library. The base station should never use the direct driver interface
as this is subject to change in an emergency (if the LCD fails to meet WHCS'
requirements.) In additiona, a subtle feature that WHCS may choose to implement would be
dynamic power saving through screen dimming. Although we assume the base
station will have wall power at all times, there may come a time where the
system may migrate over to a lower wattage current source, such as power
stealing from an HVAC unit. In this case, the system would most certainly have
to be power efficient. Despite not needing to worry about power, this function
would be simple to implement as only one microcontroller pin is required to
control the screen brightness.

\subsubsection{Touchpanel}
In order to provide a way for an end user to be able to control WHCS from the
LCD unit, there is a requirement to poll for touch events.
This subsystem can be considered a part of the LCD, but the driver is independent
from the graphics and ILI9431 drivers. These events will be dispatched
to the appropriate UI element  based on the X and Y position of the touch
event. There is also an optional Z ``position'' which represents the pressure
of the touch event. This could be used to gather more fine grained information
about the touch itself. One of the unfortunate properties of the touchpanel is
that it must be actively polled for new touches. This requires that the ADC be
constantly providing conversions, which raises the dynamic power of the MCU.
This isn't a major concern as the base station is expected to have power from the wall
most of the time.

The extent of the touchpanel interaction will occur from a \texttt{getTouch()}
method. This method will return the latest touch event, if any. The base
station will have full control over where this touch event is dispatched to.
Depending on the LCD scene (i.e main menu, boot screen), this event will be
handled in different ways.

\subsection{Schematic Breakdown}
To tie the whole design of the base station together, the schematic, created in KiCad is broken down below. The full schematic is available for viewing in \autoref{apx:base-station-sch}.

In \autoref{fig:bs-sch-crystal} we see a focused view of the Atmega32-A
microcontroller with an attached 16MHz crystal and power passives. The crystal
has two capacitors that are dependent on the target crystal. These are required
to get the correct oscillation for the external crystal. Also the AREF, VCC,
and AVCC lines of the MCU have decoupling capacitors. These are used to make
sure that the base station performs well under a large current spike. When
designing the board, these capacitors should be placed as close as possible to
the MCU to avoid a long high-current path through the ground plane. The
capacitor on the analog reference pin (AREF) is used to stabilize the reference
to make ADC conversions more accurate.

{fig:bs-sch-crystal}{base-station.pdf}{Base Station crystal and decoupling capacitors}

In \autoref{fig:bs-sch-lcd-header} we see the buses used to connect the LCD to the
MCU. This is the most pin heavy component and care must be taken not to mix up
any of the signal paths. All of the data control signals are connected to PORTD
of the MCU, the touchpanel signals to PORTA (ADC), and the 8-bit parallel data
bus completely uses PORTC. There are a few one off signals such as LITE which
is a PWM input to control the LCD's backlight brightness.

In \autoref{fig:bs-sch-pwr-nrf} we see the 3.3V 3 terminal regulator converting the
5V VCC line down. Additionally, we see the external RESET pull-up resistor and
a manual reset push button. The left corner has the pinout for the NRF breakout
board we will be using.

{fig:bs-sch-pwr-nrf}{base-station.pdf}{Base Station power schematic and NRF header}

In \autoref{fig:bs-sch-hc-05} we see the header for the HC-05. We examine this
further because of the unique electrical characteristics of the HC-05 module.
The module only accepts 3.3V power and logic. Our MCU will be running at 5V,
which means we need a 5V to 3.3V logic shifter. To simply implement this, we
used a resistor voltage divider which will provide the required logic level for
the TX pin. The RX pin does not need a shifter because 3.3V is still above the
$V_{IH}$ minimum for the MCU.

Finally, in \autoref{fig:bs-sch-isp} we see the standard ICSP header that most
AVR line microcontrollers use. This pin array will serve as a quick and easy
way to connect an external programmer to our base station while in the field.
In this schematic revision, this header can provide power directly to the 3.3V
regulator and MCU.

% Control Modules
\section{Control Modules}
What can be thought of as the ``arms of WHCS'', the control modules serve as
the main devices that seed the network with data. This data is specific to the
control module that is emitting it. The base station is more more complex than
an individual control module because it needs to be. The control modules should
be as lightweight as possible to save cost and keep power usage down. If the
control modules were too complex, then the entire cost of WHCS would increase
proportionally to the number of control modules.

\subsection{Software Flowchart}
The general flow for the control modules is much simpler than the base station
just due to the requirements of the system. There isn't as much that needs to
be done on each loop iteration. The only main module that the control module
needs to work with is the NRF radio. This can be seen in
\autoref{fig:ctrl-mod-soft-flow}. Due to the capabilities
for the NRF radio to provide an interrupt signal on the reception of a packet,
the control module actually has the ability to sleep when not doing anything.
Control modules should be as mobile as possible, which limits their overall
functionality and processing power. Without these limits, any battery attached
would quickly be drained.

\subsection{Electronic Strike}

\label{sec:electronic-strike}

The first thing we considered was whether we wanted a normally open lock or a
normally closed lock. Normally opened means that the door requires power to be
unlocked and is otherwise locked without power, while normally closed means
that the door needs power in order to be locked and is only unlocked when the
power is shut off.

\subsection{Sensor Data Collection}
The temperature sensor that we have decided to use for WHCS is the TMP36. The
TMP36 is widely available and comes in through hole and smd packages. The
temperature sensor is simple in design as it has only three pins that require
connection. The schematic shown in \autoref{fig:temp-sensor-connect} shows how the
temperature sensor would be connected to the ATmega328 on the control modules.
The VOUT pin of the TMP36 outputs a voltage signal that varies based on the
temperature surrounding the component. The voltage range is between 2.7 to 5.5
volts which will be suppliable through or logic level voltage lines.

\subsection{Light and Outlet Control}
Once we narrowed down our solution to controlling lights and outlets through
the use of a SSR, we searched for a chip that had the electrical
characteristics we were searching for. The GPIO pins of the ATmega328 that we
are using for the control modules are capable of outputting a maximum of 40mA
DC current. We needed a solid state relay that had a tolerance for 120V AC as a
load voltage, could be supplied by 5V, and needed less than 40mA for
activation/forward current. We found a solid state relay made by Sharp
Microelectronics with the part number S108T02F that met all the requirements
that we set. We confirmed that the chip is in stock and suppliable by digikey.
The chip is available at an affordable price of \$5.10. \autoref{fig:wiring-sch-ssr}
Shows a schematic using this solid state relay. The schematic for the control
module would mimic the one shown in this figure.

Wiring Schematic for Solid State Relay}

\subsection{Schematic Breakdown}
The control modules for WHCS have to be able to support communication via a
radio transceiver as well as interaction with their target endpoints.
\autoref{fig:ctrl-mod-sch} shows the schematic for the control modules that will be
implemented in WHCS. The full schematic is available for viewing in \autoref{apx:control-module-sch}. The main component of the schematic is the ATmega328.
Everything in the schematic is connected to the microcontroller in some way. In
the schematic three different VCC lines are shown. This is because the control
modules will have to access to a 3.3V line, a 5V line, and a 12V line. The
power board will supply these power lines to the control module. The 5V and
3.3V lines are necessary because they provide power to the logic chips like the
microcontroller and the radio transceiver. The 12V line is necessary solely for
the electronic strike that we have chosen.

% Android Application
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Android Application}
For most WHCS users the mobile application
will be the only physical interaction they have with the application. When we
set out for development we wanted to make an easy to use application that would
attract users to stick with our system.  Operability and usability were
emphasized in our design process. We wanted an appealing U.I. without
complexity, after all we are targeting a simple solution to home automation.

\subsection{Speech Recognition} The Android application for WHCS will offer
speech activation capabilities. These will be on top of GUI activation
capabilities. The speech activation sequence begins with the press of a button
to start the speech recognition. The user will be prompted with a microphone
and can then give his command. The commands will be formatted like {}``light
one on.'' When the user gives commands using the speech method, a notification
will be given indicating the success of interpreting the speech into a known
command. If the user{}'s speech does not match a known command, the speech will
be shown back to the user to show what went wrong. We are predicting that the
most frequent cause of this will be the Android phone mishearing the user. In
the event that the speech matches a command, the application will display the
command to the user and then perform it. The following flow chart in
\autoref{fig:android-speech} displays the sequence of events happening when a
user performs speech activation.

\ucfgfx[width=\linewidth]{fig:android-speech}{a55-img003.png}{Android app speech activation
chart}

\subsection{BlueTooth Software Design} BlueTooth will be the technology that
allows WHCS users to interact with the base station from the mobile phone. This
means that proper functioning BlueTooth software must be written to ensure that
users can interact with WHCS. From the user{}'s standpoint the only knowledge
of BlueTooth required will be the ability to perform an initial connection to
the base station.

In \autoref{fig:android-bluetooth-start} we see that the first check that is
made is to ensure that BlueTooth is enabled. The Android operating system
requires applications to ask the user whether they want to activate BlueTooth
or not. It cannot just be turned on. If the WHCS application is opened and
BlueTooth is off we will prompt to the user to turn it on and if they refuse we
will exit the application. When it has confirmed that BlueTooth is on, the
application can check to see if it knows the base station device. If the base
station device is known then the application can skip asking the user what to
connect to and can perform the connection automatically. This is what should be
happening most of the time. If the base station is not stored in the
applications data then the application will have to prompt the user to connect
to a base station. When connecting to a device there are two possibilities for
connection, paired devices and non{}-paired devices. The application will first
show the user all devices that their phone has paired with previously, in case
the application somehow forgot the base station. If the base station does not
show up in the paired devices list, the user will be able to search for active
BlueTooth devices and select the base station. At the end of this start up
cycle the WHCS application will have an active BlueTooth connection with the
base station that can be used for full duplex communication.

Once a BluetoothSocket has been opened on the Android device the application
can begin communicating with the base station. We will use a communication
protocol between the Android device to ensure the base station can properly
interact with the application. This protocol will allow the Android application
to give commands to the base station such as inquire about the state of the
control modules or to toggle state within the system. Whenever the Android
application wants to send a message to the base station the software will
create a packet with a certain structure. The packet will contain a byte for
letting the base station know that a command is being given, the command
itself, any variables for the command, and then a byte for finishing the
command. The base station will receive one byte at a time due to the serial
nature of BlueTooth communication but it will be able to parse the packets it
receives in order to figure out what action the application is trying to
perform. \autoref{fig:android-comm} shows a visual representation of the
communication between the aplication and the base station.

\section{Power Hardware}
\label{sec:power-hw}
Each power board is to convert
120VAC to DC lines of 3.3V 5V and 12V. We will also need to be able to switch
on and off 120VAC for the outlet and light switching control modules as well
switch on and off the 12V used to operate the strike. The designs for each
board will be mostly the same with slight variations depending on the
application.

\subsection{Power Consumption}
\label{sec:power-consumption}
In this section we will discuss the amount of power consumed by the boards.
First of all it is important to make note of the fact that saving power is not
of incredible importance to us. While it is important not to be incredibly
wasteful to the point that it becomes a problem, power was not something that
we decided we wanted to be competitive on. Had we wanted to be more competitive
with power, we would have taken a lot more into account and made different
design decisions. For example with the microcontrollers we would have looked
more carefully into the amount of current that they drew to help us weigh our
decisions. MSP430 boards for example would have been attractive because of the
low amounts of current that they draw. With that said we made all of our
decisions based on performance in other aspects.  The comparisons that we made
and the details that were of importance to us can be shown in the sections were
we decided on each component that we selected.

In \autoref{tab:pwr-current} below we have all the information on the amount of
current that is to be drawn from the different elements in our design. Note
that the information from the datasheet about the current drawn for the
microcontrollers is under a clock speed of 16MHz. We choose to run everything
at 16 MHz because is was the maximum speed for the Atmega32A. Although the
Atmega328P can run at a higher clock speed of 20 MHz, we decided to to make
everything consistent to run at 16MHz. The reason why we give ranges for the
currents and voltages of the microcontrollers is because there are a number of
different current voltage relationships that can achieve the same clock speed.
This isn{}'t to say however that any combination will work. If a lower current
is selected a higher voltage must be selected in order to maintain the same
clock speed of 16MHz.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Currents and voltages of devices used in WHCS}
\label{tab:pwr-current}
\end{table}

Note that the microcontroller of the control modules shows both an active and a
power saving mode. When the module is in operation it will run in active mode,
however since our microcontroller has the capability switch into a less
consuming power mode, we will utilize this mode in order to save power. The
microcontroller for the base station also has a low power setting for idle use,
yet we will not be running in this mode for the base station because it is
impractical. Some of the datasheets gave us specific information on how much
current would be drawn while for others we were simply able to estimate the
limit. For example the LCD (most of it{}'s current will be drawn from the
backlight) only gave a description of the LDO that would be 3.3V at 150mA.
Therefore we were able to assume that the current would not surpass 150mA.

As you can see the components in WHCS do not draw a lot of power. This is
because the components that constitute the system are all intrinsically low power
devices.  Based on the fact that Power = Voltage*Current and that not all these
devices will be used at a time. We can see that the devices themselves will
never really draw that much power.

Now that this data has been presented it can be used as a reference later when
the amount of power drawn plays a part in design decisions. Again this section
was not made to try and explain why certain decisions were made in order to try
and conserve power. Our design is not heavily concerned with testing the limits
of low power applications. Rather this section was made to present the data of
the power usage that comes from the devices that have already been selected to
be used in our design.
